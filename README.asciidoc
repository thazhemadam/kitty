Building kitty from source for macOS:

```
# Build kitty
./dev.sh deps
make clean && ./dev.sh build

# If you haven't already done so, create a self-signed certificate first.
# 1. Open `Keychain Access`
# 2. Choose `Certificate Assistant (from the Menu bar) > Create Certificate`
# 3. Enter a name, e.g., `kitty-patched-build`
# 4. Set "Certificate Type" to "Code Signing"
# Now, you have a newly created self-signed certificate, named `kitty-patched-build`.

# Sign kitty and add it to `/Applications`
codesign --force --sign kitty-patched-build kitty/launcher/kitty.app
cp -R kitty/launcher/kitty.app /Applications/
```
